    "Grading a multiple choice exam is easy. But how much does it tell us about what a student really knows? Dr. Dirac is giving a statistics midterm and wants to use Bayes' Theorem to help him understand how likely that a student really understands the material given that she has gotten a particular question correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Dirac knows the following probabilities based on many years of teaching:\n",
    "1. There is a problem that 60% of students know the correct answer\n",
    "2. Given that a student knows the correct answer, there is still a 15% chance that a student picked the wrong answer\n",
    "3. Given that a student does not know the answer, there is still a 20% chance that the student picks the correct answer by guessing\n",
